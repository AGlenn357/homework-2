The results for questions 1-7 are littered in the submitted documents.  
For example, look at Plane.cpp for the container from question 1.
The included documents are main.cpp, Plane.h, Plane.cpp, Airliner.h, GeneralAviation.h, ATC.h, HW2_Visualizer.h, HW2_Visualizer.cpp

I failed to import the SDL portion of this project.  My struggle was importing the library, not writing the code.
I have written what I think is needed for question 8 (the visuals) and commented those lines out.
This incluse preprocessor directives and lines inside of main.
Additionally, the comment brackets in the HW2_Visualizer need to be removed so those files can run.
I have made these lines and file comments so that the result will compile.
